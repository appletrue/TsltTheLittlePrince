## Chapter 1

**-We are introduced to the narrator, a pilot (飞行员 ,领航员 ), and his ideas about grown-ups**

Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent （ wonderful）picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval [praɪ'mɪːvl] forest 原始森林. It was a picture of a boa constrictor 大蟒蛇 in
the act (while doing something，正在(做) of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.

In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey 被捕食的动物 whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion 消化."
I pondered (think; consider) deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this: 

I showed my masterpiece (person's best piece of work， 杰作) to the grown ups and asked them whether the drawing frightened them. But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"
My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing. I drew the inside of the boa constrictor so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My drawing Number Two looked like this: 

The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside (put aside，放到一边 ) my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic [算术] and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career (profession，职业) as a painter. I had been disheartened 使灰心/气馁by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two.

Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves 独自, and it is tiresome (boring, 烦人的 ) for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.

So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes.I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona（美国） 亚利桑那州. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.

In the course of (during) this life I have had a great many encounters (meet, 遇见，邂逅) with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence (= of importance = important). I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately 熟悉地;亲密地, close at hand (very close). And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.

Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear sighted (聪明的，精明的 ), I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he or she would always say: "That is a hat."

Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.
