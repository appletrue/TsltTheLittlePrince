Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval . It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act (while doing something)  of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.

> magnificent （[/mæɡ'nɪfɪk/]  wonderful
>
>  constrictor /kən'strɪktɚ/  [n.]，*boa constrictor*  王蛇；蟒蛇。近义词： snake, serpent, ophidian
>
> primeval（ [praɪ'mɪːvl] forest 原始森林）
>
> in the act  of doing-- (while doing something) 

在我6岁的时候，在《自然世界的真实故事》这本书中看到一张精彩绝伦的原始森林图片，画着一条大蟒蛇正在吞咽一只动物。下面是图片的副本。『』

In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion 消化." 

>  prey :animal hunted or caught for food
>
> chew :[tʃʊ] ,biting and grinding food in your mouth so it becomes soft enough to swallow
>
> digest:[daɪ'dʒɛst],become assimilated into the body,**动词读作/dɪˈdʒɛst/。名词读作/ˈdaɪdʒɛst/**

书中说到：『大蟒蛇不加以咀嚼地囫囵吞咽他们捕食的猎物，之后，它们无法动弹，需要进入休眠状态长达六个月来进行消化。』

I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this: 

> pondered : /'pɑndɚ/ , think; consider

我不禁陷入深思，丛林冒险结束后，我做了一些工作，我用彩色铅笔成功地画出了我的第一幅画，人生的第一幅画，它看起来像这样：

I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups and asked them whether the drawing frightened them. But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"

> masterpiece : ['mæstəpis]  , the most outstanding work of a creative artist or craftsman， 

我展示我的杰作给大人们看，问这幅画是否吓到他们。但他们却回答说：『害怕？为什么人会害怕一顶帽子呢？』

My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing. I drew the inside of the boa constrictor so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My drawing Number Two looked like this: 

可我画的不是一顶帽子呀。它是一幅大蟒蛇正在消化一头大象。可既然大人们不能理解，我又画了另一幅，

The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside (put aside，放到一边 ) my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic [算术] and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career (profession，职业) as a painter. I had been disheartened 使灰心/气馁by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two.

Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves 独自, and it is tiresome (boring, 烦人的 ) for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.

So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes.I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona（美国） 亚利桑那州. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.

In the course of (during) this life I have had a great many encounters (meet, 遇见，邂逅) with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence (= of importance = important). I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately 熟悉地;亲密地, close at hand (very close). And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.

Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear sighted (聪明的，精明的 ), I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he or she would always say: "That is a hat."

Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.
