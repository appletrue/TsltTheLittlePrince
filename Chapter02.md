## Chapter2

** -The narrator crashes in the desert and makes the acquaintance 相识 of 结识某人the little prince **

> crash /kræʃ/ ,

飞机被撞毁在沙漠里，解说员，认识了小王了。

So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to,until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara 撒哈拉沙漠, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone (completely alone). It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.

所以我一直孤独的生活，没有一个可以真正交心的，直到六年前我的飞机出故障在撒哈拉沙漠。引擎出了问题，既没有一个工程师，也没有任何乘客，完完全全是我一个人想尽一切办法艰难的修理它。我仅有维持一周的饮用水，要面临生存甚至死亡的问题。

The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:

"If you please, draw me a sheep绵羊!"

"What!"

"Draw me a sheep!"

> isolate  /'aɪsəlɪt/, v,使隔离；使孤立 adj. 隔离的；孤立的

> shipwreck /'ʃɪprɛk/, n,遇难船;  v ,使失事；使毁灭；使失败

第一个晚上，我在距离人群聚居区千里之外的沙漠中入睡。我比遇难后的水手更加孤立，至少他们还有个筏子在海上漂着。所以你可以想象我有多震惊，在日出时分，我被一个奇怪的，小小的声音唤醒。

『请你，画一只绵羊给我吧。』

『什么？』

『为我画一只羊！』

I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked (wink the eye, 眨眼睛) my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the best potrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model. 

> blink  /blɪŋk/,  shut your eyes and very quickly open them again. 

> thunderstruck  /'θʌndɚ'strʌk/,as if struck dumb with astonishment and surprise

我彻底惊愕到跳了起来，我艰难地眨了眨眼，仔细地环视我周围，我发现一个非同寻常的小人，非常郑重的站在那儿正跟我解释着。这里你可以看到最好的画像，之后，我可以为他画，但是我的绘画一定是远不如他本人那么有魅力。

That, however,is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas (boa = boa constrictor) from the outside and boas from the inside.

然而，这不是我的错，在我六岁的时候，哪些大人们让我对绘画生涯感到灰心，之后我再也没有学过绘画，除了那个看不到和看得到肚子里的大蟒蛇。

Now I stared at this sudden apparition (ghost, spirit, .鬼，幽灵) with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited 有人居住的region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying 迷路uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue 疲劳 or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him: "But ... what are you doing here?" 

我盯着这个像鬼一样突然出现在我眼里的

And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence: "If you please, draw me a sheep."

When a mystery is too overpowering ( 过于强大 ), one dare not disobey （ obey服从）. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography,history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly (angrily), too) that I did not knowhow to draw.

He answered me: "That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep."

But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with. "No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome 笨拙的. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep."

So then I made a drawing. 

He looked at it carefully, then he said: "No. This sheep is already very sickly.Make me another."
So I made another drawing.

My friend smiled gently and indulgently. "You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram 公羊. It has horns."

So then I did my drawing over once more.

But it was rejected (refuse, turn down, 拒绝 , 否决 ) too, just like the others. "This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time." 

By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off (do quickly) this drawing.

And I threw out an explanation with it. "This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."

I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:

"That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?"

"Why?"

"Because where I live everything is very small."

"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very small sheep that I have given you."

He bent his head over the drawing:

"Not so small that. Look! He has gone to sleep."

And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.
